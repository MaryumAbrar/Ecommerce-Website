# Ecommerce Template

Welcome to my Ecommerce Template project! This project was developed as part of a Hackathon, with a focus on creating a professional, responsive, and pixel-perfect design.

## Working Pages

The following pages have been completed and are fully functional:

- **Home Page**
- **Shop List Page**
- **Shop Grid Default**
- **Product Page**
- **My Account**
- **FAQ**
- **Contact Us**
- **404 Not Found**

## Project Highlights

- **Responsive Design**: The template is fully responsive and works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Pixel Perfect**: All pages are designed with a focus on pixel-perfect accuracy, ensuring a visually appealing and professional look.
- **Best Practices**: The project follows best coding practices to ensure maintainability and scalability.

There are still some pages that need to be created to complete the template. I am continuously working on adding these pages and improving the existing ones.
